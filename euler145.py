Some positive integers <i>n</i> have the property that the sum  <i>n
</i>  reverse<i>n</i>  consists entirely of odd decimal digits For 
instance 36  63  99 and 409  904  1313 We will call such numbers <em>
reversible</em> so 36 63 409 and 904 are reversible Leading zeroes are 
not allowed in either <i>n</i> or reverse<i>n</i>

There are 120 reversible numbers below onethousand

How many reversible numbers are there below onebillion 10<sup>9</sup>
